    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table. Add everything else
    such as sentence structure below the vocabulary table.
    - GOOD: The table is correctly formatted showing origin languages for words and French spelling for French words
    - GOOD: Gives conceptual sentence structure
    - BAD: No need to add extra notes such as original French spelling is provided.

    Marhaba! (Hello!) Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on transcribing it into Algerian Arabic (Darja).
    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    [Location] [Verb-present] [Subject], [Location] [Verb-present] [Object] [Adjective].
    Before we start, let's look at some vocabulary that might be helpful:

    | English     | Algerian Arabic (darja) | Origin language | Original spelling (French)
    |-------------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
    | supermarket | سوبرمارشي (sūbirmārshī) | French          | supermarché
    | traffic.    | ترفيك (tarfīk)          | French          | trafic
    | lot         | كتير (ktīr)             | Arabic          |
    | go          | روح (rūḥ)               | Arabic          |
    | I/me        | أنا (anā)               | Arabic          |


    Note: For words of French origin, I'll provide the original French spelling in the next vocabulary table.
    Now, let's start working on the transcription! Can you try to translate the phrase "I'm going to the supermarket" into Algerian Arabic (Darja)?

    - BAD: Adds verbose text in the beginning. It should go directly to the table and all the clues should be underneath.
    - BAD: Doesn't show conceptual sentence structure, the values with question marks in the beginning are confusing
    - GOOD: The table is correctly formatted showing origin languages for words and French spelling for French words
    - BAD: Doesn't really give clues
