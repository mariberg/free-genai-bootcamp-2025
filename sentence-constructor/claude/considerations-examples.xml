Clues, considerations, and next steps:

You've correctly identified the subject "Ana" (I).
"Rah" is close, but it's not quite the right form of the verb "to go" in this context. Remember the present tense forms I provided. Think about how the verb should conjugate with "Ana."
"Nsri" is the correct present tense form of "to buy." Well done!
You've correctly used "hlib" (milk) and "bagat" (baguette), and "wa" (and) is also correct.
You're very close!  The main thing to adjust is the verb "to go."  Consider how it changes with the subject "Ana" in the present tense.  Give it another try!

Clues, considerations, and next steps:

You're still using "rohu" for "I'm going." While it sounds close, the correct conjugation of "rāḥ" (to go) for "I" (ana) in the present tense is "nruh".
